# Lane-detection-Width-Calculation-Indian-roads
The AI model can detect the Indian roads lanes at night time and also approximate the width of roads. 

Change the path to the image file inside the code and simply run:
`python motor_lane.py`

Most of the Indian road Infrastructure are missing from street light which makes any kind of detection extremely difficult at night time. #Gamma function can solve this problme. 

Test Video using Gamma function on Indian road at Night time.
